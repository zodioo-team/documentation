Cross-selling: Accessories and Optional Products
================================================

Any sales process is an opportunity to stimulate up-selling. For example, with an extra-warranty or
some accessories.

To do so, you can use *Cross-selling*, a sales technique consisting in selling a customer something
in addition to the product or service they were originally shopping for. It is a great way to
maximize the value of each one of your customers.

It can be done via two different features:

    - Accessory products on the checkout page.
    - Optional products on a new *Add to Cart* screen.

Accessory Products
==================

*Accessory Products* are products that are displayed when customers review their cart before paying.
As an example, you could suggest a mouse or a keyboard when someone buys a computer.

To add *Accessory Products*, go the :menuselection:`Website --> Products --> Products` and, under
the **Sales Tab**, add your accessories to the **Accessory Products** field.

Now, go to your website and add the product to your cart. On the payment step, you can see your
accessory products suggested to the customer.

Optional Products
=================

*Optional products* are products directly related to an item. Each time the product is added to a
cart, a pop-up appears, suggesting other products to buy.

To enable optional products, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and tick
*Optional Products*. Then, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Products --> Products` and open the
item you want to add an optional product to. In the **Sales tab** of that product, add as many
optional products as you want.

From now, when a customer adds this product to their cart, a pop-up appears and suggests to also add
git sthe optional product(s).
